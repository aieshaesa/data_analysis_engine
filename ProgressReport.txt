1. What is the progress your group has accomplished so far?
    We have completed everything except for the analysis questions at the end.
2. What percentage of your code implementation has your group finished?
    We'd say that we've done about 90% of the code implementation, all that's left is the analysis part and cleaning up some areas of code
3. Do you see any roadblocks that will prevent you from finishing this project?
    We don't see any current roadblocks, we've had a couple such as the funtions printing the results, but we've handled that already.
4. Are all students in your group working in this project sharing the workload fairly?
    Yes, we've all put in equal amount of work and have also helped each other with work that we've done.
5. What is the plan of your group to make sure your software is reliable?
    We've tested out each function with different inputs to find bugs or ways that the software will break, then we've edited the code to handle those issues.
